Abstract What drove social conflict in Spain’s industrial areas in the period
before the Spanish Civil War? This paper is concerned with contrasting the determinants of working-class conflict in northern Spain at the beginning of the twentieth
century. Our hypothesis is that the key determinant of conflicts in emerging
industrial areas during the interwar period was the struggle to obtain satisfactory
family income in a context of combined high price fluctuation, unemployment and
economic boom and bust. We suggest two new ways to decipher how economic
factors interact with labour conflict. We introduce the family as the relevant income
unit when considering wage struggles and relative deprivation. And secondly, we
study the reactions to short-term variations of income on families by using monthly
rather than quarterly or annual data.

This article seeks to discern the logic behind the blazes of social disruption in one of
Spain’s rapidly progressing industrial areas during the interwar period. The
succession and the failure of different systems of labour relations in establishing
social dialogue and providing institutions to resolve conflicts surely contributed to
the increasing social tension before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. We
propose, however, that a closer understanding of the economic factors involved in
these labour conflicts may also enhance our perception of how social conflicts came

to be. Specifically, this paper reclaims the importance of material economic
conditions in determining labour conflict in the period leading up to the Spanish
Civil War. Even though resource-accumulation and collective-action theories and
political-exchange approaches have attempted to play down, in some cases even to
question, the role of economic factors as causes of labour conflictivity (Shorter and
Tilly 1974; Snyder 1977; Tilly 1978; Shalev 1980), we consider material well-being
too important to relegate as something secondary.
We suggest two new ways to decipher how economic factors interact with labour
conflict. We introduce the family as the relevant income unit1 when considering
wage struggles and relative deprivation.2 And secondly, we study the reactions to
short-term variations of income on families by using monthly rather than quarterly
or annual data. We hereby contend that families were on tight budgets and that price
and income variations put important strain on their nutrition, health and well-being
and thereby led to a higher propensity to labour unrest.
Our analysis will concentrate on strikes, one of the key manifestations of labour
conflict, and the Bilbao estuary will constitute our geographical field of research. To
paraphrase Cohn (1993: 8), we concentrate on a closed industrial area with
comparable workers with comparable classifications and a comparable institutional
framework, using data with consistent and well-understood recording conventions.
Furthermore, the economic dynamics of a single industrial space are far easier to
grasp intellectually than are the parallel dynamics for a large and diverse economy.
As an emerging economic area since the 1870s, Bilbao developed a highly
concentrated industrial centre, becoming the most important heavy industry district
in Spain. This scenario constitutes an integrated and relatively isolated industrial
setting which, together with the use of monthly rather than annual data, reveals
different patterns of economic and social relations than those obtained with
aggregated national data.3
Many scholars of the early twentieth century will share Dick Greary’s perception
of the First World War as the watershed, a traumatic break with the politics of the
1 Kuznets (1976: 1) already insisted on using families as basic units of income measurement when
addressing distribution. More recently, the standard of living debate has focussed on family income
Humphries (1977), Horrell and Humphries (1992), Allen (2001, 2009, 2013), Humphries (2010). Rothbart
(1989) insists that ‘the wage struggle (…) cannot be understood simply as a struggle over the level of pay
for the performance of work, since a major justification for higher wages has been the argument that the
wage of adult males should be determined by the subsistence needs of a family’.
2 We define relative deprivation as the judgment that one is worse off compared to other groups and/or
compared to the past. This judgment may lead to frustration and collective action. Townsend (1974: 15)
argued that ‘individuals, families and groups in the population can be said to be in poverty when they lack
the resources to obtain the types of diets, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and
amenities which are customary, or are at least widely encouraged or approved, in the societies to which
they belong’. Therefore, poverty is the guiding concept, and we would define ‘relative deprivation’ as the
perception of poverty. At the same time, collective action and/or social conflict would be a reaction to
relative deprivation. For the recent evolution of deprivation research, see Gordon (2006).
3 Ritschl et al. (2008). As Morys and Ivanov (2011: 6) have summarized, historical National Accounts
are normally constructed with an eye for the level rather than the volatility; this (understandable)
preference determines interpolation techniques which can lead to serious differences in volatility between
the reconstruction and the true unknown series. Fortunately the disaggregate series which maintain the
original volatility are often abundant for historical periods.

pre-war ancien re´gime. For most of Europe, the war brought hardship to the
working class by way of food shortages, inflation and the massive influx of new
labour into the industrial sectors.4 The post-war period was one of price fluctuations,
strong economic cycles and unemployment. This changing economic environment
produced recurrent income shocks which deprived living conditions, making
workers more prone to unrest, a situation very similar to that Sharp and Weisdorf
(2012) have found for France’s workers prior to the French Revolution.
Although the analysis is limited to only one of the major industrial centres in
Spain at the time, at the very least, it opens the question whether similar dynamics
existed in other urban industrial areas at the time, i.e., if there was a generalized
urban industrial deprivation process that may be considered one of the causes of the
Spanish Civil War. At the same time, using monthly disaggregate series to study the
impact of the interwar economic fluctuations is an innovative approach. Oscillations
and variations have not been smoothed out, higher data frequency allows for subperiod analyses, and short-term dynamics otherwise hidden can be revealed. This
may be an approach to consider in other countries with strong social conflicts in this
period.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section of the paper
introduces a general background on strikes and the following an overview of strikes
in Bilbao, Biscay (the greater area surrounding) and Spain. Section 3 presents the
data series we have collected on strikes and economic factors. This is followed by a
detailed and concise summary of labour relations over the period we are examining.
Understanding the changing labour-relation regimes is essential for inferring the
results from the empirical contrasts. Sections 5 and 6 present the strike model, the
statistical exercises for the impact of economic factors on strike frequency, and
discuss the results. The exercises consider business profits, real family incomes and
unemployment. In order to check the robustness of our findings, property crime and
political violence are added to test whether these alternative expressions of social
disruption are also correlated with variations in material living conditions. We close
with a presentation of our conclusions.
1 Strikes and the determinants of strikes
An economic strike is a suspension of production while workers and employers
argue about how to divide the surplus from their relationship (Kennan 2008: 1).
Strikes are costly disputes. In a two-agent model of negotiation in which each party
was rational and well-informed, each would know the other party’s concession
curve and could agree on distribution of surplus without the waste implied by an
output loss through stoppage. But despite the possibility of avoiding this waste,
strikes have been commonplace in industrialized countries for the last 150 years.
Hicks (1932) was one of the first authors to articulate a theory about why strikes
occur, concluding that most of them result from faulty negotiation between workers

(1981: 134–143).

and employer. At a later point, Ross (1954) introduced a political and institutional
approach, emphasizing the role played by other agents like firm managers and
unions. He stressed the divergent interests existing between trade union leaders—
interested in the survival and growth of the organization—and rank-and-file union
members. Ross also analyzed the relationship between strikes and unions, pointing
out that strikes are only a temporary withholding of labour, whereas a union is a
permanent association of workers (Kaufman 1982: 477). Over the course of time,
strikes as ‘weapons of labour’ would have fallen into the hands and control of
business unionism. Ashenfelter and Johnson (1969) formalized Ross’s institutional
wage bargaining model, addressing that strikes are more likely the result of agency
problems and the logic of collective action.5
Economists have sought regularities between the economic cycle and the
frequency, duration and depth of strikes. For the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century, studies have shown that strikes are more frequent when general economic
conditions have been good. Strike incidence has been found to be pro-cyclical and
strike duration countercyclical to the business phase (Card 1990; Crampton and
Tracy 2003; Kennan 2008).6 Besides their economic nature, strikes may also be
called for political reasons. Theories of strikes based on economic factors tend to
have lesser explanatory power in those settings where strikes are politically
motivated (Cohn and Eaton 1989). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century, especially after 1917, strikes have often been considered a measure of the
threat of revolution. Among various forms of social unrest, such as riots,
demonstrations and social disorder, strikes are a potent menace to a regime
because they interfere with the functioning of the capitalist economic system on
which the regime is based (Kim 2007). They are also a powerful mechanism of
social mobilization.
In any case, labour conflict and strikes in particular are complex multi-causal
phenomena. Industrial workers are not a homogeneous class but a diverse group
under constant recomposition, as Vigna (2012) has pointed out recently for France.
Workers and employers develop complex and diachronic sequences of interaction.
The different approaches taken by economists, sociologists and political scientists
are an evidence of its multi-factorial and intricate nature. This diversity was
succinctly summarized by Franzosi (1995: 7–11), who identified at least seven
different theoretical approaches: business-cycle theories, which concentrate on the
relationship between business cycles, the bargaining position of labour and strikes;
relative-deprivation approaches, which sustain that deterioration of economic living
conditions and increasing social injustice are at the heart of conflict; resourceaccumulation and collective-action theories, which suggest that collective action
depends on a group’s capacity to mobilize resources and organize; institutional
theories, which propound that strike intensity is determined by the calendar of
collective contracts, especially in the case of industry-wide or nationwide
5 For a summary of strike theories, see Friedman (2009).
6 However, there are studies which contradict a pro-cyclical pattern of strike incidence. For example,
Ingram et al. (1993) for the British manufacturing sector in the 1980s; or more recently Devereux and
Hart (2011) for the British engineering sector between 1920 and 1970.

bargaining; political-exchange approaches, which concentrate on the mechanisms
used by labour-oriented social-democratic parties in order to achieve a more
favourable distribution of resources; theoretical frameworks related to class conflict,
which view long-term immiseration as the main determinant of rising labour
conflictivity; and theories of modernization, which concentrate on the breakdowns
of social groups produced by rapid industrialization and urbanization.7 Among these
theoretical approaches, we consider that changes in workers’ economic conditions
and wage bargaining were the main motivations of labour conflictivity during the
interwar period, as we explore in the next section.
2 Labour conflict determined by economic factors? Our hypothesis
and the setting for contrast
The interwar period in Europe was an age of political and social turmoil. Most of the
countries experienced unrest and tensions during those years, Spain being among
the more unstable. Although Spanish economy benefited from neutrality during the
First World War, the wartime expansion produced imbalances and rapid economic
changes with exacerbating social tensions. These tensions, kindled by the success of
the Russian Revolution, produced revolutionary outbursts between 1917 and 1919.
Growing working-class unrest and the post-war economic crisis of 1921 accelerated
the decay of the liberal political regime (1876–1923), which collapsed giving way to
military rule from 1923 to 1929. The dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera was
able to produce noteworthy economic growth. Applying a mixed policy of
repressing (anarchist trade unions) and coopting (socialist trade unions), and
introducing a corporatist framework of labour relations similar to that of
Mussolini’s regime in Italy, the dictatorship managed to keep the working-class
movement under control. However, social conflict surged again after the coming of
a democratic Second Republic (1931–1936) which freed the forces that had been
repressed during dictatorship and now resurged in the context of the world
economic depression. The interwar period in Spain ended with a gruelling civil war
between 1936 and 1939.
Our hypothesis is that the key determinant of conflicts in emerging industrial
areas during the interwar period was the struggle to obtain satisfactory family
income in a context of combined high price fluctuation, unemployment and
economic boom and bust. Following Rothbart (1989) on ‘homes are what any strike
is about’ and Humphries (1977) on the fragility of working-class families during
industrialization, we seek to contrast whether labour conflict in a time of important
economic fluctuations was determined by the subsistence needs of families. So, well
aware of shortcomings, our analysis will concentrate on wage bargaining, relative
deprivation in families, profits and unemployment as the valid elements to explain
labour conflictivity during the interwar period. We seek to find labour conflicts
driven by economic factors.

123
In light of the weak evidence for the relevance of economic variables in
explaining strike frequency found by Silvestre Rodrı´guez (2003) using aggregate
data for all of Spain, we would like to contrast the importance of economic change
and material necessity in a more closely defined geographical and temporal setting.
Such findings could indicate that a regional approach concentrated on the large
industrial nuclei of Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Bilbao may reveal very
different patterns from those obtained with aggregate macroeconomic data and that
much of the cause–effect mechanism may have been smoothed out by aggregation
and low-frequency data.
What makes the Bilbao estuary a particularly interesting case is its speed and
scale of structural change. Together with Catalonia, Biscay (the administrative
region in which Bilbao is situated) was an industrial forerunner and would be the
only other province on the Iberian Peninsula to reduce the percentage of labour
employed in agriculture to less than 50 % before the end of the nineteenth century
(Soto Carmona 1989). Biscay had gained higher access to Spanish markets in 1829
when its customs were shifted from its regional borders with the rest of Spain to its
own coast, i.e. it became part of the Spanish common market. The 1869
liberalization of mining and commerce opened its vast iron ore resources to
international markets and foreign investors, such as Great Britain, Belgium, France
and Germany. Ore trade with European iron and steel centres established the bridges
for the transfer of technical equipment and skills, and these ties provided the
markets competition and the high-quality coal needed to transform Bilbao into the
iron and steel centre of Spain. Between 1876 and 1936 the Bilbao region developed
from an iron ore mining district into the most important concentration of heavy
industry in Spain.8
Bilbao was a small geographic area in which a fairly rapid process of
industrialization took place in an isolated form. The physical constraint of social
conflicts to a local level was predominant in the political arena of the time (Fusi
1975). Regions and industrial areas in Spain tended to have specific characteristics
regarding trade unions, employers’ strategies and conflict intensity. The different
patterns of economic development and the mountainous condition of the Iberian
Peninsula explain this lack of integration. In the case of Bilbao, there were no
competing industrial loci within a reasonable distance. The closest industrial centre
was in Barcelona, some 600 km away. As one of Spain’s major ports, it had wellintegrated commodity markets and, as a consequence of the late nineteenth-century
iron-ore-mining boom, it had well-functioning labour markets. In short, the Bilbao
estuary constituted a quite isolated setting in which contagion was not a common
source of unrest.
Industrialization and structural change accelerated during the first third of the
twentieth century. In the province of Biscay, the working population employed in
industrial activity grew from 32.6 % in 1900 to 43.1 in 1920 and 47.0 in 1930; the
service sector grew from 25.7 to 33.3 and 31.5 % (Ola´barri 1978: 447). As part of

the process of industrialization, there were also important demographic changes in
the area being examined. According to population censuses, the population of the
Bilbao estuary grew from 192,747 in 1910 to 242,641 in 1920 and on to 304,364 in
1930, implying annual population growth rates of around 2.3 %. Over the first third
of the century, Bilbao was the fastest growing urban agglomeration in Spain (Reher
1994). The major immigration wave had already occurred over the last three
decades of the nineteenth century, and net migration to the estuary during the first
third of the century slowed down considerably. Between 1920 and 1935, over 85 %
of the population growth was generated by natural growth. Over that same period,
93.7 % of the population lived in family households. Over the early twentieth
century, families were evolving from extensive to nuclear families and at the same
time to predominantly male-breadwinner families with an increasing number of
children. And at the same time, over 70 % of the active population remained
unskilled day workers.9 Therefore, throughout the period of analysis, the majority of
working-class families lived in a nuclear male-breadwinner setting with an
increasing number of children. For the predominantly unskilled-labour households,
this implied a high vulnerability to changes in real income. The lack of extensive
family safety nets, heavily disputed alternative incomes in times of crises and no
foraging to fall back on are some reasons for this.
3 Data series on strikes and economic factors
In order to examine labour unrest and its determinants in detail, we have been able
to construct a very detailed monthly database for the Bilbao estuary over this period.
One of the series we use is a recently calculated cost-of-living series for a
breadwinner family in Bilbao’s iron and steel industry.10 This series has been
constructed with monthly price data from the municipal statistical bulletin. The
basket is designed to provide the energy requirements of a representative fivemember family taking into account diet habits and diet transformations. The
monthly series of real incomes is calculated from average money incomes for
workers of the Baracaldo factory of Altos Hornos de Vizcaya [AHV].11 We have
9 Population in the Bilbao estuary has been thoroughly examined by a group of demographers lead by
Gonza´lez Portilla (2001): 117, 130, 278–9, 396 and 403. Based on municipal statistics, only 9.4 % of
married women worked in 1900 and by 1935 this had decreased to 3.7 % (Garcı´a Abad and Ruzafa
Ortega 2009: 304). For a summary on how the male breadwinner nuclear family evolved see Rojo Cagigal
and Houpt (2011: 11).
10 The index is based on seventeen basic consumption goods’ price series and calculates a gradually
changing consumption basket reflecting variations in consumption patterns during the 1914–1936 period
with a gradual diet shift in food groups towards fresher products. A typical working-class family of five
members constitutes the consumption and production unit of analysis. For a detailed description of the
index calculation see Rojo Cagigal and Houpt (2011). For living standards in Biscay, see Pe´rez
Castroviejo (1992); an up-to-date account of the debate about the evolution of living standards in Spain
and France can be found in Chastagnaret et al. (2010).
11 Monthly data was extracted from Altos Hornos de Vizcaya (1914–1923). Annual averages have been
taken from Gonza´lez Portilla (1984): 74 and 85). This company was created by merger of two of the
leading iron and steel company with a smaller tinplate factory in 1901. They employed 5,905 workers in
1916 and 8,300 in 1930, approximately one third of the workers employed in the iron and steel industry.

contrasted these incomes with the maximum and minimum money wages registered
by the municipal statistics. The monthly money incomes at AHV are within or
above these bands over the complete period analysed. If any, this introduces upward
income bias, as AHV workers were considered highly paid workers at the time.
Unemployment rates were not registered for this period. We have proxied them
with inverse nuptiality rates. The choice of this proxy is motivated by the close
correlation found by Southall and Gilbert (1996) for England and Wales, and Kirk
(1960) for the interwar period in the United States.12 Wales, England and the United
States were industrial forerunners and geographical areas which showed strong
negative correlation between nuptiality rates and unemployment during industrialization; their studies include regions concentrating heavy industry. Bilbao, Wales,
England and USA also share a common demographic pattern: the nuclear malebreadwinner family. This further sustains similar nuptiality behaviour in response to
income variations. In Wales, GB and USA there are empirical data series for testing
the correlation between both variables. In the case of Spain, we lack unemployment
data. But outdoor poor relief, for which we have data and which should be highly
correlated with unemployment, moves in unison with nuptiality rates. This
strengthens our conviction that nuptiality rates proxy unemployment well.
Nuptiality rates not only reflect the marriage postponement due to unemployment
but also due to growing underemployment and to any other reduction in earnings
and income. Therefore, we use the inverse marriage rate as a proxy for
unemployment and underemployment over this period.13
Business profits and an index of business perspectives have been used to measure
the variation of economic surplus over time. Monthly business profits can be
approximated for Altos Hornos de Vizcaya between 1914 and 1921 by calculating
markups for each product produced and multiplying those by the amount of each
product sold. We have also used the monthly stock-market index for Bilbao which is
an expression of the present and future firm-value based on information on its
present profitability. Monthly strike frequency has been collected from works of
Lazcano (1950) and Sanfeliciano Lo´pez (1990). Both series are based on exhaustive
scrutiny of local newspapers. As Lazcano’s series becomes less reliable towards the
end of the period, Sanfeliciano’s series which registers only the strikes in the 1930s
will be used for the latter part.
As a first approximation to the relationship between variations in workers’ family
incomes and labour conflict, we can use the annual data on strikes provided by
Ola´barri (1978: 498) to contrast the coincidence between the number of strikes and
tensions on family budgets. Figure 1 shows the twelve-month moving average of
12 ‘If marriage and trade-union unemployment corresponded closely in timing and, in some senses, in
amplitude of variation, it is tempting to treat both as proxies for the unemployment,’ Southall and Gilbert
(1996: 55).
13 Friedlander found that from 1855 to 1901 unemployment and marriage rates were negatively
correlated in England and Wales. During the entire period, for each unemployment peak in a given year
there was a trough in the marriage rate and vice versa. His regression analysis confirmed that the change
in unemployment levels explained nearly 50 % of the variance in marriage rates (Friedlander 1992:
32–33). Kirk also found an inverse correlation between unemployment and nuptiality for the United
States, stronger during the interwar period that after the Second World War (Kirk 1960).

dearth or abundance in family budgets, i.e. the percentage difference between real
workers’ income and the lower bound cost of living. Minus 20 % indicates that the
wage is unable to buy 20 % of the family food basket and positive 10 % indicates
that 10 % of the workers’ income is still available after buying the family food
basket. Families’ ability to make ends meet follows a sharp and constant worsening
throughout the First World War and the immediate post-war years up to 1920; a
steady and rapid recovery between 1921 and 1923 is followed by gradual
improvement up to 1930. A second sharp decline is observed between 1930 and
1931, followed by stability and a slow recovery between 1932 and 1934, and further
stability in 1935.14 When confronted with data on labour conflicts, measured here in
the number of annual strikes, we find a close correlation. Strikes increase
vehemently when average nominal family incomes worsen to minimum sustainability, i.e. they are not able to acquire the amount of calories required for work
energy and basic vital needs.15 This is the case in 1917, when the situation escalated
into a revolutionary general strike, but also in 1919–20, when nominal earnings
came close to this lower bound anew, and briefly in 1922, when employers were
trying to force money wages back down to pre-war levels. The decrease in total
earnings between 1929 and 1931 again seems correlated with increasing conflict.
Over this period, breadwinner families had numerous occasions on which their
families were deprived and these coincide with moments of anger as expressed by

labour conflicts. At the same time, conflict decreased as earnings situated above
costs of living over most of the 1920s until 1930.16
The figure we present here is no more than a rough approximation. But the series
for real earnings and cost of living for an average family are based on very detailed
data proceeding from single reliable sources. The monthly data introduce
seasonality. This adds an important aspect to the issue of nutrition. Studies on
energy requirements in present-day agricultural environments in East Asia have
shown that during high-workload seasons land workers consistently consume more
energy than they take in. This is sustainable during short intervals of high
workloads, but energy reserves must be built up and recovered during idler seasons
of the year.17 Quite differently, factory work does not allow for inter-annual energyreserve compensation. Energy requirements are constant year-round and workers
will be sensitive over very short periods to sudden falls in real income. Families can
compensate for this to some point, by having the remaining members of the family
consume less.18 But in the mid-term, this would have negative effects on their health
and family well-being.19
According to our previous analysis on living conditions, real family incomes
worsened between January 1914 and December 1919. They improved from January
1920 to April 1930, and from then on worsened until August 1932. They recovered
to the levels attained in the mid-twenties by May 1935 but started a downward hike
from then on. This is visualized in Fig. 2 with welfare ratios, i.e. the number of
times a family can buy its basic consumption bundle which provides the necessary

nutrition for basic body functions, maintenance and work. Some of these results are
surprising, others expected. War and post-war economy deteriorated workers’ living
conditions, dictatorship and right-wing democracy improved them, and left-wing
democracy maintained or worsened standards of living for these workers.
Figure 3 summarizes some characteristics of organized labour and strikes in
Biscay (Bilbao and the administrative territory surrounding it) for the period we
examine. The evolution of strikes declared in Biscay is very similar to that for Spain
as a whole up to 1930. It shows a break in this year and initiates an inverse trend
until 1935, which will be explained in the discussion of results. As Friedman (2007:
28) has pointed out, strike activity is episodic, characterized by long periods of
dormancy punctuated by sudden spurts of action, or strike waves. We can observe in
this case the existence of two strike waves, the first one from 1918 to 1921 and the
second one from 1931 to 1933. Average strike duration in Biscay remained below
that of Spain throughout the period studied with the exception of 1 year.
The Unio´n General de Trabajadores (UGT), a socialist trade union founded in
1888, became the most important working-class organization in Biscay. A Catholic
and Basque-nationalist trade union, Solidaridad de Obreros Vascos (SOV), founded
in 1911, competed with UGT, although the socialists remained the leading
organization of Biscayan working class through all the period.20 In Fig. 3, we can
see that Biscay union membership in socialist UGT increased in levels during the
First World War. But the important increase in UGT membership in all of Spain did

not happen until the late twenties. UGT membership in Biscay continued growing
over the 1920s and overall we find a close association between inflation and trade
union membership.21
Table 1 shows what we can discern about the causes of strikes. Only 32 % of the
strikes registered through local press indicated their motivation. Of these, 60 %
name wage increases as the principal cause of the conflict. This is the predominant
strike cause up to 1922 and resurfaces somewhat between 1929 and 1931. Among
the other reasons reported by newspapers, readmission of workers and improving
working conditions add up to 24 % and support for other strikes or political
motivations the remaining 16 %. Still there is a clear dividing line in 1922, in terms
of wage issues being the main reason for calling strikes.
Another interesting aspect of strikes is their seasonality. Griffin found that the
seasonal movement of strikes is ‘in general determined by two elements, first the
already-existing pattern of business, and second the greater capacity for resistance
on the part of employees in the early summer and later summer as opposed to spring
and winter. Here, as elsewhere, the weather shapes the affairs of men’ (Kennan
1987: 1130). Perrot (1974: 111–12) expanded on Griffin’s idea: ‘the difficulties of
daily life, for a working class barely living at a subsistence level, were greater
during the winter—the greater necessities for such items as clothing, heating and
better nutrition, the greater likelihood of illness’. Severe economic hardship, which
the winter time typically brought to a much larger segment of the working-class
population, reduced the collective resources at the disposal of workers and therefore
their capacities to carry on strikes. We also find strong traces of summer seasonality
in strike frequency in the data for Bilbao.

Silvestre Rodrı´guez (2003) has examined annual strike data for the whole of
Spain over the first third of the century. He finds that the characteristics of strikes
disaggregated into its three components—frequency, magnitude and duration—are
comparable or slightly higher than those reported by Shorter and Tilly (1974) for
France, the US and other European countries. The pattern of Spanish strikes seems
most similar to those observed in France, Germany, Belgium and Italy. Strikes
motivated by wage increase demands were around 35 % of all strikes, according to
information collected by the Instituto de Reformas Sociales. Sector breakdown
shows construction, mining, metal working and textile as those with a highest labour
conflictivity. Strikes were also closely correlated with geographical population and
worker density. Bilbao was one of the main industrial nodes in Spain, which
explains that around 10 % of the strikes registered in Spain were called in Biscay
which concentrated approximately 2 % of total population.
The lower average strike duration in Biscay over the whole of the interwar
period, observed in Fig. 3, could be indicative of a lesser degree of information
asymmetry, better negotiation or lesser means of resistance on behalf of the
workers.22 As we have pointed out, strikes in Bilbao show summer seasonality, with
a highest incidence in July and August. No such pattern can be found in the cost of
living, unemployment, profit cycle or money wages. These seasonal patterns
changed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, they evened out and shifted more to the
month of May. No substantial explanation has been found for the high incidence of
strikes in the months between April and August, but they are a reality also in our
data.23
4 The narrative of interwar labour relations in Bilbao
Compared to other Western European countries, labour relations studies got off to a
late start in Spain. Elsewhere labour academics had made important efforts to
contrast theories about the determinants of labour conflict by collecting time series
on strikes and related variables, especially following the high incidence of work
conflict in the late 1960s and 1970s.24 Although the decline in labour union power in
the 1980s removed labour unrest from the mainstream economics research agenda,
the topic has resurfaced time and again—with important shifts (Franzosi 1989:
358–360).25 The organizational-political models proposed by Tilly (1978) and other
22 Card and Olson (1995) find higher bargaining power for workers when organized by unions.
23 For a review on the seasonality of strikes Kennan (1987: 1130); Griffin (1939: 51–54) focuses more on
the US and Knowles (1952: 157–160) on Great Britain. Knowles finds the same May seasonality for the
United States and Great Britain for the 1919–1939 period, specifically in the metal, engineering,
shipbuilding sector but also in transport and construction. The May shift may very well be related to the
First of May celebrations increasing conflictivity.
24 For a summary of countries which had collected strike data by the 1980s, see Paldam and Pedersen
(1984).
25 More recently Huberman and Young (2002), Geraghty and Wiseman (2008, 2011) have examined war
of attrition and strike outcomes in Canada in the interwar period, war of attrition with asymmetric
information in the 1880s US and the determinants of strike compromises in the US up to 1945
respectively.

authors added an interest in long-term cycles, and there was a surge in the
application of the newer developments in micro-economics—game theory, collective action and new institutional economics.26 Over long periods, the study of labour
relations in Spain remained dissociated from many of these efforts and trends.
But with the return to democracy, notable progress in collecting data and
approximating the issue of Spanish labour relations has been made. Labour history
in Spain received an important boost from the extensive empirical research of
Tun˜o´n de Lara (1972) and Soto Carmona (1989). The emerging industrial region of
Biscay was among the first to be examined with a less ideological, more academic
approach. Two monographs are considered path-breaking. Fusi (1975) provided a
thorough traditional British labour history approximation in 1975, whereas Ola´barri
(1978) connected to the structured theoretical approach marked by Walter (1970) or
Clegg (1976) only a few years afterwards. Their work laid the foundations in
defining methodology, historical sources and the academic study of labour relations
in Biscay. Later contributions have concentrated in more detail on different periods
and have extended the analysis to other regions.27
In the pages to follow, we will recount the existing narrative of what we know
about labour conflicts in the region our analysis will be concentrating on. In the first
third of the twentieth century, labour relations in Biscay can be divided into four
distinct phases which coincide with the periods of strike frequency we have shown
before: a phase of labour-relations formation and ‘all-out war’ before 1912; a
second phase of conflictive bargaining between 1912 and 1923; a phase of growing
corporatization and low conflict during Primo de Rivera’s dictatorship (1923–29);
and a period of trade union resurgence and growing conflict from 1930 onward.
The first phase of labour relations was characterized by the war of attrition
between unions and employers. It showed short waves of social agitation,
disappearance and reappearance of conflictivity, and the dominance of socialist
trade unions. On one hand, the ‘all-out war’ nature of the early industrial conflicts
can be explained by the degree to which their protesters were exploited and the ease
with which they were replaced by scabs. Union activism concentrated on miners and
dock workers, both with low skill qualification, reliant on and prone to physical
force and easily replaced with the constant stream of immigrant labour. On the other
hand, workers’ resistance societies were weak, and employer associations, aware of
their leverage, were unwilling to negotiate and keen on hungering out dissent. They
used scabs and provoked outbursts of violence to force interventions by the armed
forces and civil authorities, presuming that intervention would be in their favour.28
26 See Kaufman (1982) for an exposition on the debate over economic versus organizational-political
models. For an institutional approach to the theory of trade unions, see Kaufman (2010).
27 Rivera (1985) analyzed the labour movement in the city of Vitoria, Luengo (1990) in Guipu´zcoa; and
Castells (1993) put together a synthesis for all of the Basque regions of Spain. Sanfeliciano Lo´pez (1990)
studied the socialist trade union Unio´n General de Trabajadores (UGT) in Biscay during the Second
Republic; and Mees (1992) analysed the Basque-nationalist labour movement. Other important works
include Cabrera and Rey’s (2002) survey on employer’s associations. Miralles Palencia (1992) provides a
solid review of most of this literature.
28 A closer description of the three intense waves of strikes in 1890–1892, 1899–1903 and 1910–1911,
with the general disorganization and passivity in between and which precede the period we examine, can
be found in Ola´barri (1978: 396–404) and Fusi (1975: 81–104, 118–52, 203–21, 230–42 and 318–31).

The period between 1911 and 1923 was a phase of conflictive bargaining, which
had its foundation in the steady rise of the socialist trade union UGT, combined with
employer’s associations’ indulgent resistance during the economic boom, and the
gradual weakening of UGT power after 1920, when internal excisions and economic
slowdown allowed for a crackdown on unions.
As a result of Spain’s neutrality during World War I, Biscay’s industry had the
opportunity to reap important wartime profits. But at the same time, speculation,
hoarding, shortages and economic mismanagement doubled the prices of basic
needs.29 This led to money wages lagging behind the cost of living over most of the
war. The expansive economic conjuncture thus enclosed an explosive mix for
strikes: a working class grieved by rising costs of living and a thriving war economy
providing industrialists with extraordinary profits and therefore determined to avoid
stoppages and make concessions. These circumstances combined to creating a
period of conflictive negotiation between employers and unions. Strikes spread both
in scale and scope, but they were preceded, accompanied and followed up by
negotiations. Strikes were used as a signalling device in a ritual to extract
information on whether employers were willing and able to concede a larger share
of surplus. The climax in this phase of conflictive labour relations was attained
between 1918 and 1920 at the height of strike frequency and was followed by a slow
decline in the search for negotiation, bargaining and agreements. During this phase
of rise and decline, the large metal-working companies and the socialist unions
dominated labour relations in Biscay (Ola´barri 1978: 406–408).
Several factors contributed to the deterioration of labour relations in 1920: the end
of the war, socio-political revolutions in post-war Europe, the consolidation of the
Russian Revolution, and continuously rising prices of basic needs. Previous employer
concessions had also been strained beyond the means of small- and medium-sized
enterprises. Whereas the larger firms had excellent business perspectives as long as
their production processes did not come to a halt and were more concerned with
avoiding hold-up than with wage concessions, small firms had less economies of scale
and scope and did not profit to the same extent from wage concessions. By July 1920,
there were major divisions between the groups of large businesses and small- and
medium-size enterprises. Labour relations within the large corporate were different,
and Ola´barri sustains that only the pact between UGT and large metal-working firms
had prevented labour conflict from escalating to levels like in Barcelona and Madrid.
Due to the impact of the industrial crisis of 1921, wage concessions by big employers
finally came to an abrupt halt. In 1922, following a long series of strikes and lock-outs,
trade unions were defeated and obliged to accept substantial wage cuts.
The third phase, between 1923 and 1929, was of state-corporatist dominated
labour relations. The escalation of political and social violence in Barcelona and
Madrid, especially the growing threat of anarchist power in Catalonia, and the lack
of direction and authority on behalf of the existing Restoration political factions led
to a military coup d’e´tat. General Miguel Primo de Rivera had staged what was
29 The cost of a basic food basket which included heating and lodging for working-class families in
Bilbao grew from 100 in September 1914 (beginning of WWI) to 168 in November 1918 (end of WWI),
and to 224 in December 1920 (price peak during the war and postwar period). See Rojo Cagigal and

intended to be a short transitional military take-over, but later clung to power in an
attempt to create a moderate corporatist state aimed at overcoming social unrest and
the tensions and antagonisms between the old and new forces of power and wealth.
This involved the repression of the more radical trade unions and seeking the
collaboration of the more moderate socialist union within the dictatorship’s
corporatist labour-relations management.
Primo de Rivera gradually introduced corporatist institutions to articulate
bargaining. Some time before, at the beginning of the twenties, the last liberal
governments had organized comite´s paritarios as tools of intermediation and
resolution of disputes between unions and employers in some industrial sectors.
However, the use of these corporatist arbitration boards had been sporadic. One of
the main reasons was that, like their Italian counterparts, Spanish industrialists
were sceptical about the binding effectiveness of negotiating in such bodies as
long as trade union membership remained non-compulsory.30 A broader corporatist system of labour relations was enacted in 1926, when Minister Eduardo
Auno´s published a decree creating the National Corporatist Organization. The
decree extended the use of comite´s paritarios to all industrial sectors and
organized them into local representative bodies, industry-based tribunals and
corporations. The corporations integrated all the comite´s paritarios of a branch or
industry and organized them hierarchically placing the Ministry of Labour at the
peak of the organizational pyramid (Perfecto Garcı´a 1977). Auno´s’ corporatist
architecture retained the more liberal dispositions but restructured it and increased
the degree of government intervention. Although Primo de Rivera had created a
single official political party, he made no attempt at verticalizing unions. In
contrast to other corporatist experiences of the time, Auno´s’ model allowed for
pluralism both for unions and employer associations. The repression of the more
radical unions and the hierarchical corporatist structure imposed by the
dictatorship gave the existing moderate unions the opportunity to consolidate
workers’ representation on arbitration boards. The socialist union UGT, which
was the dominant trade union in Biscay at the time, collaborated decidedly in this
scheme.31 Economic growth and higher wages during the 1920s made the
collaboration of UGT and the growing corporatization of labour relations easier to
defend towards its ranks and files.32
The improvement of industry-workers’ living conditions, the unions’ defeat in
1922 and early repression on behalf of the dictatorship had undermined union power
in Biscay over the first half of the decade (Castells 1993: 161–162). This steady
decline in membership and UGT’s pragmatic stance had pushed the organization to
30 The liberal political elites rejected compulsory trade unionization because it clashed with basic liberal
principles like the freedom of association (Rey Reguillo 1992). See also Adler (2002).
31 Weak government intervention combined with trade-union pluralism induces Linz (1981: 382) to
define this model as a ‘social corporatism with pluralist features’.
32 Over the 1920s, up to 1929 industrial production increases by little over 60 %, i.e. an annual average
growth rate of almost 5%, from 1929 to 1935 it fell by approximately 1.5 % per year (Prados de la
Escosura 2003, Tables A.5.7.& A.5.8).

123
actively participate in Auno´s’ corporatist system. From 1927 to 1930, the socialist
union put into practice an intensive campaign to position themselves in the comite´s
paritarios contending with the yellow Catholic and Basque-nationalist unions.33
The system by which delegates were elected was ruled by a proportional-majority
system, creating a bias towards the dominant position of UGT in the dictatorship’s
arbitration boards, especially in the metal sector (Iba´n˜ez and Pe´rez 2012: 122). This
in turn fed back into higher levels of affiliation. UGT had increased its ranks and
files from just 4,000 members in 1924 to almost 18,000 in 1928 (Ola´barri 1978;
Otaegui 1986; Castells 1993; Iba´n˜ez and Pe´rez 2012).
The fourth phase of labour relations, from 1930 to the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War in 1936, was a period of higher conflictivity. The social peace was
disrupted in the year 1930 by the final decay of the Primo dictatorship. This was the
year of greatest labour conflict in Biscay in the period between 1926 and 1936,
coming close to the highest levels attained after the war. The literature stresses two
factors that explain this resurgence. Firstly, the dominance and overrepresentation
of UGT in the corporatist bodies kindled rivalry and hatred in the ranks of the
contending unions, especially in the communist unions. Secondly, the fall of Primo
de Rivera opened a period of uncertainty in which arbitration seemed doomed to
disappear. In preparation for a new institutional setting, a programmatic stance
rendered better future returns. In this situation, unions—including UGT—increasingly called strikes with a political or revolutionary motivation (Ola´barri 1978:
427–428). Strikes seeking the re-admittance of workers also propagated, especially
in the metal sector, a sign of growing defiance and attrition. Unemployment did not
affect labour relations in 1930, given that it did not appear until the end of the year.
The number of employees in the larger iron-and-steel concerns actually increased
slightly between December 1929 and December 1930 (Miralles Palencia 1988:
117). Economic contraction and consequent unemployment made its appearance in
1931.
The proclamation of the Second Republic in April of 1931 modified the labour
relation’s institutional framework anew. The leftist-republican governments developed a social-reform agenda aimed at improving the standards of living of the
working class. The strategy designed by the socialist Labour Minister, Francisco
Largo Caballero, was to maintain the corporatist structure of collective bargaining
created during the preceding dictatorship, but imposing a stronger bureaucratic
control by the Labour Ministry through the local and provincial delegations. Two
laws in November 1931 enacted the new legal framework for collective bargaining.
It endorsed the creation of arbitration boards—renamed jurados mixtos—in all
sectors of the economy and encouraged detailed and lasting collective bargaining
agreements, termed bases de trabajo (Soto Carmona 1989). The new legislation and
the Ministry’s firm leading hand developed a dense network of collective bargaining
in Spain, which showed some degree of similarity to the institutional setting which
33 Catholic trade unions (Sindicatos Cato´licos and Sindicatos Libres) and Basque-nationalist unions such
as SOV, also with a strong Catholic background, defended religious and family values, respect for private
property, and rejected strike action. These unions strongly favoured negotiations and agreements with
employers. SOV was financed by one of the most important entrepreneurs of the time, Ramo´n de la Sota.
See Mees (1992).
Relative deprivation and labour conflict during Spain’s industrialization
123
existed during the latter half of Primo de Rivera’s dictatorship.34 Biscay made good
use of the jurados mixtos, producing a long record of balanced settlements, much
more than other regions of Spain (Sanfeliciano Lo´pez 1990: 337).
5 What the short-term analysis of data reveals during conflictive bargaining,
1914–1923
With these different labour relation regimes in mind, our endeavour will be twofold:
to reveal what is hidden in the monthly data by concentrating on the short-term
factors generating labour conflict, and to combine this with our primary interest to
discern the economic factors contributing. Here we are especially interested in the
variation of income via prices or money wages, which would provoke situations of
relative deprivation. We approximate the impact of economic factors on labour
conflictivity in a simple wage bargaining model initially proposed by Ashenfelter
and Johnson in 1969 and more recently discussed by Kennan in 1987, Franzosi in
1995, and Farber in 2001.
35 This approach has shown to be more successful with
quarterly data than with annual frequency.36 Seasonal dummy variables are included
to capture regularities in specific moments of the year. It also includes a variable
which reflects the cumulative effect of real earnings variation in the recent past, the
level of unemployment and a measure of perceived business profits. The
Ashenfelter-Johnson model is a non-equilibrium model of strike activity which
tries to detect the play of forces between what workers need to ask for and whether
they are in a position to ask for it, and what employers are able to concede and
whether they are willing to concede it.

1930s see Rojo Cagigal (2009: 97–8).
35 For discussion and comparisons of the model see Mumford (1993) and Goerke and Madsen (2004).
36 Quarterly data for United States in Aschenfelter and Johnson (1969), for Great Britain in Pencavel
(1970), and for Canada in Abbot (1984). (Kennan 1987: 1122).
37 In the original model St
0 is the probability of a strike, which should be approximated by St/N, the
number of observed strikes over the number of contracts that are renegotiated. The probability must be
proxied by the total number of strikes registered, which is consistent with assuming contracts being
renegotiated evenly throughout the period.
38 In the original model these seasonal dummies were included to capture the termination of contracts, in
our case we include them to capture omitted seasonal variation in general. December shows the lowest
strike frequency worldwide and also in Bilbao in this period.

included as a two-period moving average. The lag structure is based on our previous
work on family income, pawning, child abandoning and mortality. Two months is
the statistically significant lag length with which these families react to deprivation
in the form of increased pawning, which we assume to be indicative of the time with
which economic strife seriously affects working-class families (Rojo Cagigal and
Houpt 2011).
Although we were more interested in seeing how short-term hardship affected
strike frequency, we have also followed the bargaining-model modification
proposed by Stern by using both income levels and changes in order to capture
the effect of prosperity and relative deprivation, respectively (Stern 1978). UNt is
the current level of unemployment proxied by the inverse of nuptiality. As we have
commented before, nuptiality rates not only reflect the postponement of marriage
due to unemployment, but also growing underemployment and any other form of
reduction in earnings and income. pt-6 is the six-period lagged Bilbao stock
exchange index.39 Business perspectives, real income and unemployment rates will
interact to signal the give-and-take dynamics between employers and workers, and
their willingness to grant concessions and support collective action, respectively
(Franzosi 1995: 32–33). T is a time-trend variable introduced to approximate
structural changes in the bargaining model, and et is an error term.
In the original model, the expected signs for the coefficients of real income and
unemployment are negative. The previous level of profits has an undetermined sign.
This is because an upturn of profits increases the probability of management to give
into wage demands but also tends to increase wage demands made by workers—
perhaps more than what management would be willing to concede. The combination
of the wage demands and the concession curve of employers in each particular case
will determine whether unions lead workers to strike and thereby the expected sign
of changing profits remains undetermined. A positive sign would indicate the unions
demand more than what profits are signalling employers to be willing to concede.
The table below shows the results of the OLS estimation in regression (1). In the
majority of the cases, every one of the coefficients is in the expected direction
(lagged earnings variation—negative; lagged profits—positive and unemployment—negative) and is statistically significant. The results provide strong support
for the material-needs explanations for strikes.40 The serial correlation in the first
regression is indicative of omitted variables and, together with the analysis of the
residuals, recommends a GLS estimation—presented in specification (2). This
second estimation pushes unemployment out of the foreground, but earnings
variations and profits remain significant variables.41 Both specifications reflect the
peak seasonality of strikes in summer months, very similar to what the original
39 We have applied a 6 month lag to the Bilbao Stock Exchange index based on Moore who calculated an
average six month lead for troughs and a 5 month lead for peaks between the United States Common
Stock Price index and business cycle in the United States between 1873 and 1945. (Moore 1983: 148).
40 This is similar to what Skeels (1982) found for the first half of the twentieth century in the US with the
exception of the 1920s. See also Kaufman (1982: 484–89).
41 If the differences in the coefficients estimated by OLS and GLS can give us any hint on the variables
omitted from the model, these would be such that they lower the effect of changes in real income and that
of unemployment. Higher job security and better working conditions are possible candidates.

model found for the United States and other industrial countries. Both estimations
show that economic factors are capable of explaining an important part of the
variability of strike frequency over the period.
The residuals for the GLS regression (2) shown below reflect the three periods of
labour-relations regimes in Biscay during the period we examine. The first period of
conflictive bargaining stretches from 1914 to 1923. A closer look at Fig. 4 reveals
important surges in strike activity—July 1917, May 1919 and August 1920—which
are not explained by the movements of the explanatory variables included in the
regressions. All the observed strike peaks are replicated in the estimated values but
they are underestimated. Economic variables alone cannot explain the explosive
nature of conflict in this stage, although it does very well in explaining when strike
waves do occur within that particular economic bargaining framework (Table 2).
During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship (1923–1929), the fitted observations
continue to pick up strike occurrence until 1926, when the arbitration boards enter
the scene. Thereafter, until the end of the dictatorship, strikes practically disappear.
In the last phase of labour relations, the wage bargaining model fits the observed
data well during the first 2 years (1930–1931), but is completely inadequate when
corporatist bargaining institutions are reintroduced.

Relative deprivation and labour conflict during Spain’s industrialization

For the socialist union UGT, strikes stopped being a signalling device after 1926.
They were no longer part of a procedure for obtaining ‘rite’-full redistribution as it
had been in the previous period. Before 1923, asymmetric information and
redistribution may have been at the base of strikes. Private information about the
demand and profitability of its products was withheld by the firm. Strikes became a
device to make firms signal whether they had good enough business perspectives to
therefore grant higher wages immediately or whether they had poor perspectives and
resisted the strike to force lower wages demands. Ex post the private information on
demand would become available to labour by way of the audited accounts in the
shareholder reports, dividend announcements and the climate of prosperity workers
breathed in their shops. The production foregone by strikes may be considered the
cost of extracting such private information at each moment of time.
In any case, it is worth noting that if anything remained in place during the
following phases of corporatist labour relations, it is the high sensitivity of strikes to
decreases in real earnings—see both regression (4) and Table 3. As we can observe
in specifications (5) and (6), this income-variation sensitivity remains significant
even when we add long-term variations in incomes or the differentiated effect of
unemployment—trough and peak variables of unemployment which emphasize the
opposing impact that unemployment may have on strike frequency. As expected,
unemployment plays a significant role when emphasizing low unemployment
phases—peaks. Tightening labour markets encourage workers to strike in the early
thirties. But the increasing threat of job loss and rising unemployment and
underemployment discourage them from stoppages as the decade preceded. At the
same time, neither long-term variations nor short-term variations in income can be
discarded as determinants of higher strike propensity.
It might be interesting to insist on the similarity to other studies for this period.
Knowles (1952: 314) found that strikes in post WWI Britain were mainly aimed at
avoiding decreases in wages. Both Knowles for Great Britain and Griffin (1939: 68)
for interwar America place particular importance on 1920–1921, a period in which
wholesale prices fell by more than a third in both the United States and Britain. In
that same period, strikes fell by 30 % in 1921 and 67 % in 1922 in the United States,
and by 50 % in Great Britain in 1921 (Kennan 1987: 1116). Strikes acquire a
completely different meaning in a context of growing recession. They will no longer
be used as a tool for extracting information on business perspective. Rather than
this, they will be employed as a defensive mean in order to curb placing the weight
of economic adjustment on workers.42
Some very convincing evidence on pro-cyclical fluctuations of strike activity for
the interwar period was provided by Jurkat and Jurkat (1949) for the United States
between 1915 and 1938.43 The NBER business cycles were divided into nine
phases: phases one, five and nine being trough, peak and trough, respectively. The
total number of months between trough and peak—or peak and trough—were
42 For a summary of this sort of ‘defensive strikes’, see Naples (1987).
43 This has also been pointed out by Rees (1954) and Weintraub (1966); although questioned by Scully
(1971), who found differences in the frequencies of both cycles using spectral analysis. Nevertheless it
adds the interesting aspect of how inflation and strikes relate to each other.

divided into three phases of equal length, expansion phases two, three and four and
contraction phases six, seven and eight, respectively. We apply this same
methodology to the cost-of-living index we have for Biscay, and for each phase,
we count the amount of strikes in that phase expressed as a per cent of the average
number of monthly strikes over the whole cycle. Therefore, 73 % in the first cycle
during phase one means that the number of strikes observed in these 3 months is
73 % of the average monthly number of strikes over the whole cycle. Again Table 3
shows there is a high level of coincidence between these price-real income cycles
and the relative frequency of strike waves. Strikes occur over average in the
expansion and peak phases of inflation.
Knowles (1952: 147) stressed the cost of living as a non-direct indicator of
economic pressure on the worker’s life, in so far as worker’s families live on narrow
margins they might be expected to resist rises in the cost of living by striking.
Applying this older methodology to measure economic pressure on worker’s life,
we find that the cyclic movement in the cost of living is very closely tied to the
strike cycle. Strikes have a high incidence at the peaks of basic-needs price
increases and linger on after.44 Relative deprivation of families cannot be discarded
as ultimate source of labour conflict during neither of the two cycles. As to why
strike frequency does not remit until some time after prices stop increasing, perhaps
Hoffer (1951: 27–28) has best expressed the dormant nature and lagged timing of
addressing grievance: ‘Discontent is likely to be highest when misery is bearable;
when conditions have so improved that an ideal state seems almost within reach. A
grievance is most poignant when almost redressed (…) it is not actual suffering but
the better taste of things which excites people to revolt’. With this in mind, we can
return to the change in the bargaining scenario initiated by the dictatorship in
November of 1926.
6 What the short-term analysis reveals during corporatist bargaining,
1926–1936
As we have seen before, the corporatist arbitration boards introduced in 1926 by
Labour Minister Eduardo Auno´s opened the door for the socialist trade union UGT
to institutionalize bargaining and outrival contenders.45 The new regime followed a
two-tiered strategy of repressing radical left-wing unions—anarchists and communists—and at the same time offering power and overrepresentation to the socialists
and, at a lesser extent, to the yellow unions—Catholic and Basque nationalist. UGT
merely followed a pragmatic strategy of gathering power, consolidating its
organizational prowess and converting itself nationwide into the hegemonic trade
union it had been in Biscay.
44 Goerke and Madsen (2004: 395) summarize the literature which insists on inflation fostering strikes if
workers have not been compensated for the resulting loss of purchasing power.
45 For the corporatization of interest intermediation, see the seminal work of Schmitter (1974). For an
analysis of the process of corporatization in authoritarian regimes in interwar Europe, see Pinto (2012).

Therefore, the socialist trade union pounced on the opportunity to consolidate
their power from within the state during Primo dictatorship and then promoted the
system on as a solid vehicle to continue accumulating power during the first years of
the Republic.46 The scenario of labour relations we can describe for 1931 is that of a
region which is increasing its organized collective bargaining, which has growing
union membership, mainly socialist and Basque nationalist, and which is facing a
severe situation of unemployment—much higher than any other part of Spain. The
important political involvement with which the masses reacted to the new pluralist
regime, the high expectations for improvement harboured in the new government
due to its socialist participation, the mounting strength of unions and the growing
unemployment combined to a highly explosive me´lange. But quite contrary to what
might be expected, in Bilbao it generated one of the lowest strike frequencies in
Spain.
A possible explanation for the low labour conflictivity was the strategy of
moderation employed by the two most important unions. In the beginning, in 1931,
workers blamed employers for lay-offs and production cut-downs. They accused
them of sabotaging the consolidation of the new political regime.47 As a reaction,
socialist union leaders conducted an important campaign of contention, convincing
workers that the cause of unemployment was exogenous and that the measures taken
by employers were justified by the severity of demand contraction. The operation
included visits by government officials, newspaper campaigns and wide-scale
factory briefings (Castells 1993: 167–168). The Basque-nationalist union SOV
developed a similar policy of finding a non-conflictive way out of recession. Both
trade unions promoted alleviation of the crisis through the jurados mixtos; the
creation of a short-term unemployment insurance; organizing fundraising to pay for
unemployment benefits; increasing the capacity of soup kitchens; or lobbying the
government, especially socialist Public Works Minister Indalecio Prieto, for public
works stimulus packages as a means of reactivating the construction and iron and
steel industries (Ola´barri 1978: 428–429).48 As a result of their combined efforts,
strike activity was more restrained between 1931 and 1933, to the contrary of what
happened in other regions of Spain.
Once socialist unions lost their grip on the captured state after the political right
won the elections in November of 1933, they turned their organization and
discourse to revolution. How had the ranks and files been accommodated so easily
over the two previous years of the Republic? Between its sixteenth congress in 1928
and its seventeenth congress in October of 1932, UGT carried out a strong
centralizing reform within the trade union. This included the creation of 37
46 The coming of the Second Republic also increased union membership in Biscay. Socialist UGT
affiliates grew from 18,000 members in 1928 to more than 31,000 in 1934. The second most important
union, the Basque-nationalist Solidaridad de Obreros Vascos, increased its membership from 6,200 in
1929 to 18,000 in 1935. Union pluralism re-legalized anarchist and communist unions, prohibited during
the dictatorship, although their activity remained limited to very occasional conflicts.
47 The most important strike motives during 1931 were the re-admittance of laid-off workers and the
reduction of the working day.
48 According to Sanfeliciano Lo´pez (1990): 301), the underemployment or the unemployment itself was
the main obstacle to sustain the workers’ demands via strikes.

‘National Industrial Branches’ which came under the full control of the national
trade union hierarchy. Strikes and relations to employers were relegated to the
centralized bodies of the union (Iba´n˜ez and Pe´rez 2012: 145).49 For Tilly (1989:
444), ‘to the extent to which crucial decisions visibly take place at a national scale
(…) and the power position of labour is uncertain, we can expect political strikes to
become prominent’. In such a scenario, the temporal patterns of strikes should
change accordingly, in order to accommodate from the local productive fluctuations
to changes in policy, regimes and power on a national level.
UGT’s strategy of consolidating more organizational power within the corporatist-state framework could have produced a strategic response by other unions
which could have influenced the strike cycle. In order to test this, we have modified
the original model to include a dummy variable we have named ‘rivals’. This
dummy variable will be zero over almost all of the period and take value one for the
months surrounding the publication of agreements struck by the arbitration boards
(comite´s paritarios until the Republic and jurados mixtos afterwards) in the metal
sector of Biscay —the highest institutionalized sector in industry.50 The hypothesis
being tested here is that rival unions would intensify strike activity whenever UGTdominated arbitration boards obtained agreements on holidays, minimum wages,
overtime compensation or wages adjustments. Two motivations are behind this type
of sabotage. On one hand, it sends a strong signal to employers that UGT does not
represent all workers and that other unions should have a higher presence in the
arbitration boards. It also undermines the authority of UGT as a negotiating party.
On the other hand, the publication of such agreements can be used to convince
workers that they have been sold out by UGT and rally anger for protest. As we can
see in Table 4, the ‘rival’ variable is significant and positive for both of the models
we specify. The political struggle we observe here is therefore not one tied to
national politics but rather driven by the rivalry of competing unions at moments
when arbitration boards publish the agreements they have negotiated in Bilbao.
Two other interesting results are, on one hand, the change in the seasonality of
strikes, especially the high incidence of strikes in the month of May—a common
pattern in Great Britain and United States—and the other result worth noting is that
the economic variables remain relevant in this new regime of labour relations.
Grievances have retained their spontaneous impact on strike frequency and firm
profits and unemployment continue to show the correct coefficients and are
significant [Table 4, (2)].
The impact of unemployment should be significant especially in the 1930s, when
the effect of the economic depression on industrial employment in Biscay was
particularly harsh. The iron and steel industry and metal-working industries were
especially hard hit, followed by mining and construction. The three sectors added up
90 % of unemployment in Biscay (Rivera 2002: 128). The increase in unemployment reached its heights between 1931 and 1932 and failed to drop substantially in
49 Nevertheless as Cruikshank and Kealey (1987) insist wages figure prominently both in times of union
strength and weakness.
50 Publication dates are taken from Prat and Molina (2011: 14). Dummy variable takes value one for the
month before publication, the month of publication and the two months following publication.

the following years. In January of 1936, approximately 25 % of the payroll was laid
off, another 25 % was working reduced shifts. Close to 50 % of the metal-industry
workers were suffering unemployment or underemployment. Biscay had the highest
unemployment rate in Spain, around 20 %.51 The unemployed metal-workers in
Biscay were 38 % of all unemployed metal-workers in Spain. Unemployment
numbers did not vary substantially in the Biscayan metal sector over the period,
whereas they began improving by 1934 in other regions of Spain (Miralles Palencia
1988: 117).52
Edwards (1978) has suggested that the relation between unemployment and
proneness to strike can be either inverse—due to the tightness of labour markets
during low unemployment—or direct—due to discontent during moments of high
unemployment. This is why we had included trough and peak variables of
unemployment in the specifications in Tables 2 and 4.
53 We saw that unemployment
played a significant role when emphasizing low unemployment phases—peaks.
Tightening labour markets encouraged workers to strike in the early thirties. The
threat of job loss and rising unemployment and underemployment throughout the
thirties discouraged them from stoppages.
Some additional insight might also be gained from criminal statistics. If
relative deprivation is a driving force for labour conflicts, it should also be
systematically related to political violence and property crime.54 In the
regressions in Table 5, we see that property crime shows both seasonality and
a high negative relation to lagged earnings and unemployment. We had found
that a decrease in workers’ income is followed by a proportional increase in
mortality with a lag of 5 months. We therefore calibrate the moment of a
maximum impact on families to be 5 months after a decrease in real income. At
this point of time, desperate situations would lead to desperate solutions. The
hypothesis that social disruption in the form of property crime may be driven by
short-term variation in earnings as a consequence of price increases cannot be
rejected with these results. Both seasonality and the significant inverse relation to
income level should incline us to think that property crime may be driven by
short-term economic hardship. On the other hand, political violence has an
inverse relation to strike frequency—political violence is high when strikes are
51 There are no reliable statistics, and given the difficulty of estimating the impact of reduced hours, this
is the magnitude usually assumed by the literature.
52 Biscay accounted for 2.06 % of the Spanish population and 4.2 % of the unemployment. (Rivera 2002:
128).
53 For the calculation method of troughs and peaks, see Edwards (1978: 376).
54 Literature has usually established a direct correlation between poverty and theft. According to the
theoretical work developed by Becker (1968), people resort to crime only if the costs of committing the
crime are lower than the benefits gained. Therefore, those living in poverty have a much greater chance of
committing theft. For the link between economic conditions and crime, see the summary of Johnson
(1995: 137–141) for pre-1914 Germany; or the work of Mehlum et al. (2006) for nineteenth century
Baviera; and Traxler and Burhop (2010) for Prussia, which show a strong correlation between real wages
and crime rates; and Bignon et al. (2011) for nineteenth century France. Bignon et al. (2011) also include
references to contemporary studies.

low.55 This offers less support to our hypothesis unless the repression of strikes
on behalf of accommodating unions is creating frustration over passivity.
7 Conclusions
Quite contrary to previous literature, we find solid evidence for the economic forces
being systematically related to labour conflict in the interwar period. This may be
due to using disaggregated series and higher data frequency. Monthly data, real
worker’s earning instead of GDP per head, family unit measurement of impact of
price fluctuations, a regional perspective for analysing what at that time was a
strongly segmented economy, are but a few of the elements that may have
contributed to finding different results.
Labour and social conflict in Bilbao, considered the highest wage earning
industrial area in Spain, was driven by short-term variations in workers’ family real
incomes, profit cycles and unemployment. When we use the cyclic movement in the
cost of living to measure economic pressure on worker’s life, we find that this is also
very closely tied to the strike cycle. Strikes have a high incidence at the peaks of
basic-needs price increases and linger on after. Both results are indicative of a redistributional conflict. Even when workers’ claims for higher real incomes are
repressed by authoritarian rule or refrained by moderate pragmatic union policy,
they remained latent and resurged. Only on occasions of moderation did political
motives move more to the foreground. But even during the Second Republic
(1931–1936), in a period of high political mobilization, strikes still reacted to
economic factors’ variations.
During the Republic, when the socialist trade union UGT had its ranks and files
under tight control and was negotiating collective agreements, we have been able to
trace back some of the political character of strikes to the inter-union struggle for
worker representation. The receptiveness of workers to more radical agitators is a
sign of discontent and can be interpreted as a reaction to expected economic
improvement which has not been forthcoming. The moderation of strike activity in
the 1920s, when living conditions were steadily improving, gives further support to
economic factors determining labour conflictivity. The short-term reaction of strikes
and property crime to changing economic conditions gives more sustenance to the
hypothesis of precarious family incomes and sensitivity to relative deprivation. Both
phenomena are coherent with theories on the coming of civil conflict in Spain:
‘Revolution growth is the product not of extreme oppression but of relatively rapid
improvement in conditions (Spain during the 1920s) in countries where notable
internal problems are followed by a downturn or significant new frustrations’ Payne
(2009: 4).
The paper provides important evidence on the correlation between variations in
material well-being and labour unrest in the prelude to the Spanish Civil War, which
in itself was a prelude to the Second World War—both major turning points in the

social distribution of income. From a theoretical point of view, the analysis reopens
the debate on the importance of economic factors as determinants of labour
conflictivity and, ultimately, social unrest. Economic factors have been largely
displaced by the organizational and political explanations for the labour unrest in
this period. Our results suggest that this may be due to the use of aggregate and
yearly data. The use of monthly data and disaggregate series give strong support to
the prevalence of economic factors determining conflictivity. It challenges the
present state of the question on the Spanish interwar period which affirms that
economic factors had little or nothing to do with labour unrest and thereby reopens
an important debate within the context of the period leading up to the Spanish Civil
War: were there economic causes to the conflagration? As a minimum it demands
further work on the major industrial centres in Spain. It also gives reason to believe
that monthly rather than yearly data could give far greater insights on the impact of
interwar price fluctuations and production crisis on labour unrest in other European
industrial areas.
