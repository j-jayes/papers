					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Strike outcomes in the 1880s had a "winner-take-all" 
character. Successful strikes ended with a discrete wage gain; failed 
strikes ended with a return to work at the prestrike wage. We present a 
theoretical interpretation of these outcomes based on a war-of-attrition
 model. We fit an empirical model specifying the capitulation times of 
the two parties and the size of the wage gain in the event of a strike 
success. The results show a systematic relation between the determinants
 of strike success and the determinants of the wage gain for a 
successful strike.</td>

						<td>This article examines the relationship between collective 
action and the size of worker and employer groups in the United States. 
It proposes and tests a theory of union formation and strikes. Using a 
new county-by-industry level dataset containing the location of unions, 
the location of strikes, average establishment size, and the number of 
establishments around the turn of the twentieth century, I find that 
unions were more likely to form and strikes were more likely to occur in
 counties with intermediate-sized worker groups and large employer 
groups.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Abstract Debate on the role of international unions (unions 
with headquarters in the United States) in Canada is longstanding. One 
school of thought maintains that internationals have weakened Canada's 
union movement; another view holds that international and national 
unions acted in concert and increased the number of disputes and the 
likelihood of workers' victory. Using a newly created data base of 
strike dimensions for the period before World War I, the key years of 
union growth in Canada, we test these opposing views in a 
competing-risks framework. We find that internationals did not weaken 
Canada's union movement; nor did the two union types act in concert. 
Instead, internationals were absorbed in Canada's industrial relations 
framework.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Electricity is a general purpose technology and the catalyst 
for the second industrial revolution. Developing countries are currently
 making huge investments in electrification, with a view to achieving 
structural change. What does history say about its impact on the 
structure of employment? We use U.S. Census data from 1910 to 1940 and 
measure electrification with the length of higher-voltage electricity 
lines. Instrumenting for electrification using hydroelectric potential, 
we find that the average expansion of high-voltage transmission lines 
between 1910 and 1940 increased the share of operatives in a county by 
3.3 percentage points and decreased the share of farmers by 2.1 
percentage points. Electrification can explain 50.5% of the total 
increase in operatives, and 18.1% of the total decrease in farmers 
between 1910 and 1940. At the industry level, electrification drove 
15.7% of the decline in the share of agricultural employment and 28.4% 
of the increase in the share of manufacturing employment between 1910 
and 1940. Electrification was thus a key driver of structural 
transformation in the U.S. economy.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Notwithstanding the popularity among economists of attributing
 the surging inequality of recent decades to technology–skill 
complementarity, researchers with a keen eye on history have been 
reluctant to pick up this thread. This paper joins Claudia Goldin and 
Lawrence Katz’s attempt to examine the role of electrification as an 
example of a technology that is complementary to workers’ rising skill 
levels. Sweden electrified manufacturing processes rapidly in the first 
quarter of the twentieth century, while the supply of skills through 
secondary education only increased significantly in the 1950s. We use 
industry-specific information from the Swedish Industrial Census of 1931
 to establish whether electricity and the use of white-collar workers 
correlated positively. The results indicate that the correlation was 
positive, but the estimated effect was rather small. Moreover, the 
available evidence for skill ratios does not suggest that inequality, 
thus measured, increased. We conclude that labor market institutions 
prevented—and also overturned—the inequality push emanating from 
technology.</td>

conflicts were introduced all over the world in the early twentieth

analyze the impact of mediation on conflict outcomes in Sweden for the 
period 1907–1927. Causality is identified by using the distance from the
 mediator’s place of residence to the conflict as an instrument. Despite
 the mediators’ limited authority we find that their involvement in a 
conflict resulted in about 30 percent higher probability of a 
compromise. The results add support to institutionalist accounts of the

						<td>Understanding the initiation of conflict is fundamental for 
the success of efforts in conflict prevention. The validity of the 
mechanisms of the “Greed and Grievance” model, alongside leadership and 
external interventions are tested in four periods of initiation and 
intensification of the conflict in Angola. All mechanisms are present 
but their relative relevance varies throughout the conflict. Among the 
mechanisms identified in each period the most relevant in the Cold War 
period are the international and regional interventions in 1961 and 1975
 and in the post-Cold War period, the “greed” factors in 1992 (oil and 
diamonds, poverty and war capital) and the UNITA leadership of Jonas 
Savimbi in 1998. The case study provides evidence that “greed” and 
“grievance” can be interlinked (such as in 1992) and confirms the 
relevance of leadership and external interventions mechanisms.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Current forecasts paint a dismal future for unions; observers 
in the 1920s and 1930s also projected bleak prospects for organized 
labor. Analysts in the interwar years were off the mark. This paper 
seeks to investigate whether the revival of the labor movement before 
WWII was the result of institutional change, in particular the coming of
 the CIO, or the outcome of an internal dynamic that gave rise to rapid 
declines and spurts in growth. We test these two views in a 
war-of-attrition context, using a newly constructed data set on Canadian
 strikes between 1920 and 1939. Estimation is undertaken in a 
competing-risks framework. We find that workers did not cave in when 
employers sought to break their unions, and under certain conditions 
workers could outlast employers. The increasing proportion of worker 
wins in the early to mid 1930s led to the rise in union membership 
observed before the arrival of the CIO in Canada in 1937. We conclude 
that current predictions regarding the end of unions in the twenty-first
 century may prove to be premature. Tout comme les analystes 
contemporains, certains observateurs des annees 1920 et 1930 predisaient
 un avenir sombre a la syndicalisation. Leurs previsions etaient 
fausses. Cet article vise a verifier si la renaissance des syndicats 
avant la Deuxieme Guerre mondiale est associee a un changement 
organisationnel, soit l'arrivee du CIO, ou le resultat d'une dynamique 
interne qui produit des periodes de croissance et de decroissance 
rapide. En utilisant une nouvelle banque de donnees sur les greves au 
Canada entre 1920 et 1939, dans un modele de guerre d'usure, cet article
 teste ces deux propositions. Nous trouvons que les travailleurs n'ont 
pas recule face aux menaces des employeurs et dans certains cas ils ont 
remporte des conflits. Grâce a ces greves gagnantes, le nombre de 
travailleurs syndiques s'est accru meme avant le CIO. On conclut que les
 previsions courantes vouant les syndicats a la disparition au 
vingt-et-unieme siecle sont prematurees.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Abstract The received view is that, across countries and time,
 strike dimensions trace an empirical regularity. The incidence and 
duration of contract strikes move in opposite directions over the 
business cycle: incidence is procyclical and duration countercyclical. 
The Canadian experience in the interwar years was different. Strike 
incidence was independent of the business cycle and strike durations 
fell steadily over the period. A distinct pattern emerged. The 1920s saw
 a decline in strike activity and steady losses for workers; in the 
1930s strike activity gained momentum and there were more worker wins. 
Our interpretation of this extraordinary episode is based on a new data 
set collected for the period 1920 to 1939. We evaluate strikes in the 
context of a war-of-attrition model and estimate the probability of 
strike outcomes (success, failure, or compromise) and capitulation times
 (for firms and workers) as functions of firm and striker 
characteristics. We find that workers capitulated first in the 1920s 
because firms used replacement workers as part of a larger strategy to 
break the union movement. In the 1930s, it was firms' turn to capitulate
 first because they had cut back on resources to fight strikes, even as 
workers became more belligerent.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Schap, Guest and Kraynak (2013) examines time series 
properties of medical net discount rates (MNDRs) based on three 
different, short-term Treasury securities. The article finds attributes 
of stationarity in each of the series examined and notes greater support
 for total offset of interest rates and medical cost growth rates than 
does previously published research. The present study makes four 
adjustments to Schap, Guest and Kraynak (2013). First, the data set is 
updated by two years and four months. Second, the t-test applied in the 
original study and also used in earlier studies of total offset fails to
 account for autocorrelated error terms, so a substitute test is applied
 to both the original data set and the newly extended data set, with 
results reported. Third, Phillips-Perron testing is conducted in 
addition to Augmented Dickey-Fuller and 
Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin testing of stationarity of the various
 series analyzed, with results reported. Finally, Zivot-Andrews testing 
is applied diagnostically, to identify stationary sub-series of MNDRs, 
similar to an approach used successfully to identify stationary 
sub-series of wage net discount rates (Schap, Baumann and Guest, 2014). 
The data analysis suggests two options available to practicing forensic 
economists who endorse the use of Treasury securities of short duration 
in formulating MNDRs. One option is to use total offset (i.e., a zero 
MNDR), based on modestly favorable empirical support in the period 
1981:01 to 2014:10. The alternative option would be to rely on a body of
 evidence amassed over a shorter time frame, from 2001:01 to 2014:10, 
but which has remarkably strong stationarity properties and yields MNDRs
 between minus 1.5 and minus 2.0% (i.e., an implicit forecast of medical
 cost growth exceeding the discount factor).</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>There is a wide-spread concern that technical change may spur 
social conflicts, especially if workers are replaced with machines. To 
empirically analyze whether job destruction drives protests, we study a 
historical example of a revolutionary new technology: the adoption of 
electricity. Focusing on the gradual roll-out of the Swedish electricity
 grid between 1900 and 1920 enables us to analyze 2,487 Swedish parishes
 in a difference-in-differences framework. Proximity to large-scale 
water-powered electricity plants is used to instrument for electricity 
adoption. Our results confirm that the labor saving nature of 
electricity was followed by an increase of local conflicts in the form 
of strikes. But displaced workers were not likely to initiate conflicts.
 Instead, strikes were most common in sectors with employment growth. 
Similarly, we find that the strikes were of an offensive rather than a 
defensive nature. Thus, electrification did not result in rebellions 
driven by technological anxiety. It rather provided workers with a 
stronger bargaining position from which they could voice their claims 
through strikes.</td>

Gothenburg, P.o. box 625, Se-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden. (Written in

papers that connect with two broad research fields: economic growth and 
labour market conflicts. in the introduction i provide a theoretical 
framework and i elaborate on the methods and material used in the 
papers. in Paper 1, i investigate the topic of inter-industry propensity
 to strike. earlier research has suggested that some groups of workers 
have struck more than others. one such group is dock workers—known 
within labour history and industrial relations for their militancy 
across time and space. but as shown in the paper, there is no empirical 
evidence for the particular strike-proneness of dockers up to WWii. Port
 strikes seem to have been not so much a quantitative as a qualitative 
phenomenon: the position of dockers in the distribution chain gave them 
the potential to disrupt society to a degree far exceeding most other 
occupational groups. in Paper 2, co-author christer thörnqvist and i 
study the 1909 Swedish General Strike. the strike was not powerful 
enough, and the trade unions and the Swedish trade union confederation, 
Lo, met a crushing defeat. our focus is the functioning of the 
transportation system—and the ports in particular—an aspect of vital 
outcome for the strike, but one which is underdeveloped in previous 
research. We make the argument that Lo did little or nothing to support 
the strikers in the ports, and that export could continue with the 
assistance of strikebreakers. one of the factors explaining Lo’s 
disinterest in port affairs was its overall strategy to respect the laws
 of the state; at the time it was a crime to even try to force someone 
to strike, or in any way prevent someone from working. in Paper 3, i 
examine technology and productivity in the pre-container Port of 
Gothenburg. i argue that technological change was gradual for a long 
period of time and that the forklift and pallet—adopted in the late 
1940s—were responsible for setting off a series of changes. the 
productivity figures i present strongly indicate growth up to WWii—an 
empirical finding that contrasts with results from other ports. in the 
postwar years productivity continued to grow, but at a faster rate 
compared to the prewar years. the pattern of productivity offers 
tentative support for the contention that the impact of the forklift was
 revolutionary. in Paper 4, i discuss the transformation of the Swedish 
labour market in the first half of the twentieth century: from high to 
low levels of conflict activity. i critically evaluate the power 
resources hypothesis, saying that the seizing of governmental power by 
social democrats in the 1930s gave the working class opportunity to 
shift focus: from costly strikes within the industrial sphere to less 
costly redistributive policies within the political sphere. As an 
alternative explanation i emphasize intra-labour tensions. communism, 
syndicalism and social democracy showed diverse attitudes towards 
industrial militancy, and the relative strength of the three ideologies 
affected conflict activity accordingly. KeyWordS: port technology, port

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article claims that the role of pre-war grievances as a 
predictor of violence against civilians in civil wars may have been 
systematically underestimated because the “grievance hypothesis” has not
 been properly tested. Pre-war grievances can only affect civilian 
victimization in civil wars if they have been intensely mobilized in the
 period close to the outbreak of the conflict and if there is a 
temporary collapse of state capacity. This article presents a “fair 
test” of the grievance hypothesis. It analyses in depth a specific case 
of a pre-war grievance that met these two conditions. This case is the 
conflict around land property rights in Catalonia before the Spanish 
Civil War and its effects on violence against civilians during the war. 
The results show a non-negligible effect of pre-war grievances on 
civilian victimization.</td>

						<td>How do firms respond to technological advances that facilitate
 the automation of tasks? Which tasks will they automate, and what types
 of worker will be replaced as a result? We present a model that 
distinguishes between a task's engineering complexity and its training 
requirements. When two tasks are equally complex, firms will automate 
the task that requires more training and in which labor is hence more 
expensive. Under quite general conditions this leads to job 
polarization, a decline in middle wage jobs relative to both high and 
low wage jobs. Our theory explains recent and historical instances of 
job polarization as caused by labor-replacing technologies, such as 
computers, the electric motor, and the steam engine, respectively. The 
model makes novel predictions regarding occupational training 
requirements, which we find to be consistent with US data.</td>

						<td>This paper presents and discusses a recently digitized, 
dataset of strikes and lockouts in Sweden for the period 1859-1902. The 
dataset, which originally was collected by Axel Raphael by 
retrospectively browsing through newspapers, pre-dates the Swedish 
official statistics on work stoppages that began in 1903. Whereas 
Raphael’s data have been used to illustrate the long-run development of 
strikes, labour historians have been hesitant or completely dismissive 
towards the usefulness of his work. This paper reviews, and deepens 
previous assessments of Raphael’s data and compares his data with the 
official statistics for the period after 1903. This renewed assessment 
leads to three conclusions. Firstly, the coverage of the data is much 
better after 1885 than before. Trends and fluctuations in conflict 
frequency obtained from Raphael’s data for the later period are probably
 accurate. Secondly, there are also in the later period a lot of missing
 information in how conflicts are described, for example with regard to 
number of participants and outcomes. Thirdly, there are good 
opportunities to complement, and enhance, Raphael’s dataset by browsing 
through more newspapers or consulting other sources.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>How do major technological breakthroughs affect workers in the
 wake of its adoption? We contribute to the understanding of this 
question by studying the impact of early electricity adoption, using 
newly digitized, detailed maps of the US electricity grid in 1918, 1928,
 and 1940. Moreover, we follow individual workers over time by linking 
individuals in the 100% count Census of Population for 1920, 1930, and 
1940 to studty the impact of electricity adoption on employment, job and
 sectoral mobility, as well as earnings. To identify the causal impact 
on worker trajectories, we exploit the geography of hydro-electric 
potential, which is highly heterogeneous across U.S. regions and 
provides arguably exogenous variation in the incentive to adopt 
electricity. Unlike earler studies, our analysis is neither limited to 
particular industries nor particular geographies and constitutes the 
first comprehensive analysis of individual worker trajectories in 
response to a major technological revolution in the US. Our preliminary 
results uncover a number of interesting insights: on average, 
electricity (1) replaces jobs; (2) causes substantial upward movement in
 the earnings distribution for farm workers; (3) causes individuals to 
perform substantially different tasks than before; (4) is a causal 
driver for the movement from the farm to the factory.</td>

						<td>Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to suggest to the 
conflict study scholars a new instrument – the “conflict volcano” that 
could be an effective and appropriate tool for conflict analysis. 
Design/methodology/approach – The “conflict volcano” model was designed 
as a qualitative method for conflict analysis with a focus on cause 
analysis. It was developed on the basis of “conflict tree” which 
underwent modifications. Findings – The benefit of the “conflict 
volcano” is that it covers all aspects of conflict starting from root 
cause to catalysts and can reveal a wide range of causes: material, 
immaterial, institutional. It clearly frames factors; this helps 
practitioners to determine what should be considered as causes and 
effects. Moreover, the “conflict volcano” reflects major theoretical 
representations of the conflict and its aspects. While the “conflict 
volcano” model can study conflict phases from latent until open 
violence, it cannot reflect the dynamic of conflict and cannot 
demonstrate its evolu...</td>

						<td>Abstract The conceptualization of poverty lines has often 
relied on the absolute measure of deprivation. However, scholars have 
for long agreed that feelings of injustice accompanying experiences of 
deprivation becomes active when such experiences are negatively compared
 with similar others. This sort of analysis presumes that absolute 
deprivation itself is not a sufficient condition for frustration. This 
study compares the reaction of a sample of low income urban dwellers 
(n=383) on indices of absolute and relative deprivation to determine 
which measure better predicts respondents’ willingness to engage in 
collective action as a result of deprivation and actions they recently 
participated in. The results of the study showed that neither construct 
predicts willingness to embark on collective action or actual action. It
 was therefore recommended that Social Movement organizations willing to
 foster change should emphasize more on changing structural conditions 
and resources for mobilization rather than the victim’s feelings or 
experiences of deprivation.</td>

						<td>We study the projected impact of automation on employment in 
the forthcoming decade, both at the macro-level and in actual (types of)
 sectors. Hereto, we unite an evolutionary economic model of 
multisectoral structural change with labor economic theory. We thus get a
 comprehensive framework of how displacement of labor in sectors of 
application is compensated by intra- and intersectoral countervailing 
effects and notably mopped up by newly created, labor-intensive sectors.
 We use several reputable datasets with expert projections on employment
 in occupations affected by automation (and notably by the introduction 
of robotics and AI) to pinpoint which and how sectors and occupations 
face employment shifts. This reveals how potential job loss due to 
automation in “applying” sectors is counterbalanced by job creation in 
“making” sectors as well in complementary and quaternary, spillover 
sectors. Finally, we study several macro-level scenarios on employment 
and find that mankind is facing “the usual structural change” rather 
than the “end of work”. We provide recommendations on policy instruments
 that enhance the dynamic efficiency of structural change.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper revisits the Power Resource Theory by testing one 
of its more influential claims: the relation between the strength of the
 labor movement and the reduction of industrial conflicts. Using panel 
data techniques to analyze more than 2,000 strikes in 103 Swedish towns 
we test whether a shift in the balance of power towards Social 
Democratic rule was associated with fewer strikes. The focus is on the 
formative years between the first general election in 1919 and the 
famous Saltsjobaden Agreement in 1938, the period when Sweden went from a
 country of fierce labor conflicts to a state of industrial peace. The 
spatial dimension provides new possibilities to test the theory. We find
 that Social Democratic power reduced strike activity, but only in towns
 where union presence was strong. Powerful unions in themselves did not 
reduce local strike activity. On the contrary, we find that the rise of 
the Social Democratic Party in municipal governments offset about 45 
percent of the estimated effect of growing union presence on industrial 
conflicts. We do not see any significant tangible concessions in terms 
of increased social spending by local governments after a left-wing 
victory as predicted by Power Resource Theory. Instead the mechanism 
leading to fewer strikes appears to be related to corporatist 
explanations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>We study changes in Sweden’s political class during the rapid 
rise of the Sweden Democrats, a radical right party that went from being
 of negligible importance in 2006 to the third largest party in 2014. We
 associate the growth in support for the Sweden Democrats to a series of
 policy reforms in 2006 that led to a significant widening of the income
 gap between those robustly attached to the labor market (the “core” 
workers) and those with precarious attachment (the “non-core,” including
 primarily the sick and the non-stably employed). We show that the 
Sweden Democrats grew by supplying politicians that closely resemble the
 population mix of core vs non-core, while the mainstream parties 
maintained a “product-line” of mostly high-earning core members of the 
labor force. At the same time, the Sweden Democrat candidates have less 
educational attainment, and less experience in politics and the public 
sector. Thus, the growth of the Sweden Democrats increased descriptive 
representation of the economically disenfranchised, but did so at the 
cost of lowering the average level of policy expertise in the political 
class.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The second Congo war (1998–2003) was a very complex conf lict 
that involved a vast array of actors, interests and issues. After a 
stalemate was reached on the battlefield with none of the warring 
parties able to achieve military victory, peace negotiations became the 
only viable option to end the war. Civil society organisations were 
directly involved in both the peace process and the subsequent 
transitional dispensation designed to resolve the conf lict, providing 
some sort of popular legitimacy to these two processes clearly dominated
 by politico-military forces. The central argument of this article is 
that while civil society involvement in the peace and transitional 
processes was instrumental in resolving the conf lict underpinning the 
second Congo war, it entrenched a legacy: the politicisation of the 
civil society movement as inaugurated in the early 1990s. Indeed, 
although ground-breaking, the direct involvement of civil society in the
 management of transitional institutions contributed to weakening its 
member organisations as many of their leaders were either directly 
recruited into existing political platforms or simply decided to 
establish their own political organisations and join active politics.

						<td>We analyse how job training requirements interact with 
engineering complexity in shaping firms’ automation decisions. A model 
that distinguishes between a task’s engineering complexity and its 
training requirements predicts that when two tasks are equally complex, 
firms automate the task that requires more training. Under plausible 
conditions this leads to job polarisation, and in particular to 
polarisation of employment by initial training requirements. US data 
provide empirical support for the model’s implications. Training 
requirements and a measure of engineering complexity account for much of
 US job polarisation from 1980 to 2008.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Why do trade unions organize antigovernment strikes in some 
countries but not in others? This article argues that there is a 
curvilinear relationship between union density and political strike 
activity. Political strikes are rare in countries with low union 
density, since effective protests require a basic level of 
organizational capacity. They are also rare in countries with high union
 density, since a government that faces a strong union movement has 
powerful incentives to adjust its policies in order to avoid open 
confrontation. But political strikes are relatively common in countries 
with moderate levels of union density, since it is difficult for 
governments and unions to find viable compromises when the strength of 
the unions is not secure. The empirical part of the article estimates 
the relationship between union density and the likelihood of political 
strikes in two samples of advanced democracies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The study explores time series properties of three wage net 
discount rate series derived using interest rates based on 
(alternatively) 1-year, 6-month and 3-month Treasury securities coupled 
with wage growth rates, initially for the period from 1981:01 to 
2012:06, then subsequently through 2012:12. Stationarity tests are run 
on the full series and various sub-series to identify any portion of the
 series on which reliable forecasting can be based. Initially no support
 is found for the total offset hypothesis based on the full-time series 
(but support is subsequently found for total offset when exploring 
various data sub-series). Positive findings include that the three 
trended wage net growth rate series for the entire period under study 
are stationary, implying that reliable short-term forecasting of wage 
net discount rates is possible based on each of the trended series. 
Short-run forecasts based on the trended series are presented for 
2012:07–2012:12 and compared to actual data in the period. Finally, the 
three trended wage net discount rate series are re-examined for 
1981:01–2012:12, with short-term forecasting equations presented. 
Various sub-series of WNDRs are then explored in hopes of finding one or
 more that may be stationary about a constant term. Additional testing 
identifies three sub-series all ending 2012:12 with varying start dates 
that have desirable stationarity properties. The sub-series starting 
2007:11 is highly stationary, but peculiar, with an associated constant 
WNDR that is negative and statistically different from zero; and the two
 sub-series beginning 1990:12 and 1994:05 have stationary attributes, 
yet possess constant terms that are slightly positive but not 
statistically different from zero, thus providing modest support for the
 total offset method.</td>

						<td>This paper studies the impact of the construction of 
hydropower facilities on labor market outcomes in Norway at the turn of 
the twentieth century (1891–1920). The sudden breakthrough in hydropower
 technology provides a quasi-experimental setting, as not all 
municipalities had suitable natural endowments and the possible 
production sites were often located in remote areas. We find that 
hydropower municipalities experienced faster structural transformation 
and displayed higher occupational mobility. We interpret this as 
evidence that this early twentieth-century technology was skill biased, 
as workers in the new skilled jobs were recruited from a broad segment 
of the population.</td>
